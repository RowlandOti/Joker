A joke displaying app, using AppEngine as the backend. It is a demonstration of the concepts I learnt when attaining the Udacity Android Nanodegree. I learnt to:  
 Add free and paid flavors to an app, and set up your build to share code between them 
 Factor reusable functionality into a Java library 
 Factor reusable Android functionality into an Android library Configure a multi project build to compile your libraries and app 
 Use the Gradle App Engine plugin to deploy a backend Configure an integration test suite that runs against the local App Engine development server
